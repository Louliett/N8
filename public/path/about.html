          <p>OUR VISION

            HAY has always believed that good design is everyone’s right. That’s why, from the very beginning,
            co-founders and Creative Directors Mette and Rolf Hay committed to working with their generation’s best
            designers from all over the world to create high-quality products that would be available to a wide
            audience. This founding principle continues to motivate us today. </p>
