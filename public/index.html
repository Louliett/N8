        <p>For this page we aimed at creating a minimalistic look with the best ease of use for our customers. We went for a simple unintrusive design throughout all the site pages. We made sure our users could always find their way around the page with little trouble or confusion. A user login system was implemented to allow customers the option to save their details and make the checkout process as painless as possible.</p>
        <p>For the admin pages we went with a simple layout that is self explanatory so no need for new admins to be trained. These admin pages also provide maximum manipulation of the page. Allowing for dynamic items addition and removal. This page being secured from unauthorized access by personalized login and session cookies.</p>
