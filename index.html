          country in Eastern part of Europe, with no future. I was always interested
          in computers programming and technology but for some reaseon I decided to
          2 years of Law in Romania and another 2 years of Law in France.
          I didn't like it. That's when I decided to try what I really was interested
          in and it worked!

          <h4>Column 2</h4>
          The closest I got to work with these elements, was in highschool
        creating an html file and in HKR creating CSS files for JavaFX. For this
        course section I learned how to execute git commands inside the git bash.
        Previously I was using intellij's integrated GitHub commands for push,
        commitm, pull and so on. I learned to tag my commits, a thing no one
        taught us before, up until this moment. I learned to open an HTML file
        with GitHub pages.

          <h4>Column 3</h4>
          I knew that javascript is used to privide functionality for a web page,
        and CSS is used how to design the appearence of a page. An html file
        will arrange the components of a page such as headers, titles footers
        and php is used to establish the connection between a web page and a
        database
