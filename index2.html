          My name is Andrei Casian. I was born and raised in Moldova. It's a small
          country in Eastern part of Europe, with no future. I was always interested
          in computers programming and technology but for some reaseon I decided to
          2 years of Law in Romania and another 2 years of Law in France.
          I didn't like it. That's when I decided to try what I really was interested
          in and it worked!
          I'm in my 3rd year of Software Development and looking forward to finish it!
